      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>
        I'm currently enrolled in Los Rios Community College, Folsom, pursuing Business Administration and Economics. I have completed rigorous coursework, such as Financial and Managerial Accounting, Intro to CIS, Calculus 1 & 2, and Macro/Micro Economics, which has prepared me to transfer to a UC. As a committed member of the Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society, I contribute to community service projects and promote academic excellence among my peers. My strong analytical and problem-solving abilities have been enhanced through the successful completion of advanced math and economics courses.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will be attending the University of California, Los Angeles, where I will be pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Business Economics. My focus will be on advanced quantitative and analytical techniques to drive data-driven decision-making in the business environment. I am eager to engage in hands-on learning experiences through UCLA's renowned experiential learning programs and improve my skills in research, data analysis, and strategic problem-solving. I will diversify my academic portfolio with courses in microeconomics, macroeconomics, econometrics, and managerial economics to gain a comprehensive understanding of complex economic theories and their real-world applications. I am committed to continuous improvement and personal growth through participation in UCLA's diverse array of workshops, seminars, and professional development resources tailored to Business Economics students.
